# PetRadar API (Zero Project)
Here I share my experience in Python 3.13 development and backend architecture.

**PetRadar (Zero Project)** is a backend service built with FastAPI that helps users  find veterinary clinics, grooming salons, and pet shops in their city. <br> 
The first test region is **Vologda, Russia** — a city located 700 km north of Moscow.
## Tech stack (Technologies Used)
— Python 3.13<br>
— FastAPI<br>
— PostgreSQL / SQLite<br>
— Docker<br>
— Pydantic<br>
— Pytest<br>
— Git<br>

## Features (Possibilities)
1. Endpoints to retrieve list of:<br>
— veterinary clinics: `/clinics`<br>
— grooming salons: /`grooming`<br>
— pet shops: /`shops`<br>


2. Keyword-based search 
3. Built-in interactive API documentation at `/docs`<br> 
4. Unit testing implemented with **pytest**<br>
5. Enviroment-based configuration using `.env` file<br>

## TEsting Region
— **City:** Vologda, Russia<br>
— **Note:** Located ~700-750km north of Moscow<br>
— Initial datd will focus on local services within this are<br>
